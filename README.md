# Going-Medieval

## Purpose

The purpose of Going Medieval is to be a quick and simple strategy-game that you can play right on your browswer. Users can male an
account, log in, and then all of their progress is saved into our databases, so they can come back any time, and pick up right where they
left off.

## Technologies Used

-Express
-SQL and Sequelize

## Usage

After the user arrives at the homepage, they will be greated with a welcome message and a current leaderboard. Navigate over to the links
on the top-right of the screen and click on 'register' to create an account. From there, you can access the game world and start playing.
When you start, find a tile on the map to claim as yours for your kingdom. Now you can claim more tiles that will provide you with resources that you
can use to train troops. If you want to attack another players kingdom, simply click on their tile and use the "Attack" button. If you are attacked and defeated,
all your resources and land will be lose and you'll have to start again.
